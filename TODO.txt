Ideas for later:
 - Refactor Parser to use more libs (eg: Scanner, Tokenizer)
 - Add a File handling service, so parser can be more modular.

 - It's powerful.  Now, make it easier.
 - Make 'base' files that users can pull in to get started quickly (eg: swearing.txt, hate.txt, etc.)
 - Multiverse-support? (Different configs for different worlds)
